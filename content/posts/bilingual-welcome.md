# Welcome

I have updated my blog to support both English and Traditional Chinese!

You can switch languages using the menu at the top of the page.

## How it works

- Content is written in Markdown.
- English files are named `filename.md`.
- Chinese files are named `filename.zh-tw.md`.
- Hugo automatically links them together.

Enjoy reading!
