# Blog Enhancements Walkthrough

I have successfully upgraded your blog with a premium look and new features.

## 1. Visual Polish ✨
- **Custom Fonts**: Integrated `Inter` for UI and `Lora` for articles for a modern, readable feel.
- **Refined Color Palette**: Overrode default colors with a "Midnight Blue" theme for dark mode and crisp white/blue for light mode.
- **Animations**: Added subtle hover effects to post cards and smooth transitions for theme toggling.
- **CSS Location**: `assets/css/extended/custom.css`

## 2. New Features 🚀
- **Instant Search**: Added a search bar (powered by Fuse.js) to the menu. You can now find articles instantly.
- **Projects Portfolio**: Created a dedicated `/projects` section to showcase your work, separate from the blog feed.
- **Resume & About**: Updated these pages with a clean, professional layout.

## 3. Interactive Elements ✨
- **Magic Dust Mouse Trail**: Added a colorful particle trail that follows the cursor on desktop devices.
- **Mobile Optimized**: The effect is automatically disabled on touch devices to preserve performance.

## 4. Verification
- **Build Status**: The site builds successfully with `hugo --minify`.
- **Content Structure**:
    - `content/projects/`: Contains your portfolio items.
    - `content/search.md`: Required for the search page.

## How to Preview
Run the local server to see the changes:
```bash
hugo server
```

## Next Steps
- **Add your real projects**: Edit `content/projects/ai-assistant.md` and add more.
- **Update your Resume**: Fill in the details in `content/resume/index.md`.
